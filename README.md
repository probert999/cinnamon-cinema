<br>As a Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Manager
I want to allocate seats to customers
So that I can control reserved seating for the theatre
<li>GIVEN a customer wants to request some tickets
<li>WHEN they request a number of seats between 1 and 3 for a movie
<li>THEN the customer should be allocated the required number of seats from the available seating plan
<li>AND the seats should be recorded as allocated

### Acceptance criteria

<li>All of the seats are available for sale when the program starts
<li>Once there are not enough seats available to be allocated then the program can halt
